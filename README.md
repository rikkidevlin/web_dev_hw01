# My First Intro-Web-Dev homework
## Rikki Devlin
I decided to take this class because I feel as though web development is a skill I will use and value as I move forward in my career. I'm more interested in design then in development but I know that I should be as well rounded as possible in order to stand out in the application process. Experience in web development will open more doors in design.

- There is no central control
